        <img class="img-responsive larger-image" src="http://i65.tinypic.com/2ivi8hf.jpg">

        <p>The Black Knight concept came about as Arthur and his faithful knights of Camelot began to disagree on matters that were imperative to the survival of the great kingdom of Camelot. Each knight would argue their reasons and often those reasons
          while seemingly the right course of action, would cause them to stray from the Code of Chivalry that bound them in their brotherhood. Thus, the idea of the Black Knight became more and more popular with Arthur and his advisors.</p>
        <h3>The Black Knight Revealed</h3>
        <p>The concept of the Black Knight was basically very simple. A knight who was bound only by the Code of Chivalry and who would owe allegience to no man nor kingdom. Of course Arthurs knights balked at the idea of a Rogue Knight until to them was
          explained the true nature of this Black Clad Warrior. In truth, the Black Knight was only a symbol. His armor was worn and shared between the greatest of Arthurs Knights to combat evil and wickedness when royal reason and proclomations could
          not prevail. Each of the kings knights took a turn, according to his best skills and would appear as the Black Knight to bring justice and law soley according to the Code of Chivalry, reguardless of the laws of kingdom or man. The Black Knight
          was truly the Champion of Right and Justice. This was his mantra and battle cry.</p>

        <h5>The Secret of the Black Knight</h5>
        <p> Black Knight would serve only humanity. No kings nor their armies would be allowed to sway the knight from his duty to his fellow man. According to this method, the Black Knight would immediately be labeled a rogue by many kings and their minions
          but Arthur persisted. He believed that if his faithful knights would share the role of this black clad warrior in secret that the honor and glory attained by the Black Knight would not only never be forgotten, but the position would never be
          misused for personal gain. Black was chosen as the knights creed and color because it is a nuetral color with no ties to king or kingdom, and also it led to an air of mystery that surrounds this figure to this very day.</p>
